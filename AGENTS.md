# AGENTS.md

How to work in this repository. Read this first, then the CLAUDE.md files:
`CLAUDE.md` at the root, and `crates/<crate>/CLAUDE.md` for the crate you
touch. They describe the architecture and every decision already made; follow
them unless the user says otherwise.

## The project in one paragraph

`leo` is a note app in Rust: a terminal UI and a website (`leo serve`) over
Markdown notes, with Felix, an AI study buddy. Cargo workspace, layered:
`leo-core` (notes, store) ← `leo-services` (AI providers, config, recording)
← `leo-tui` and `leo-web` (core only) ← root `leo` binary. Never add an upward
dependency. The website's page is plain JS in `crates/leo-web/src/web/`, served
with a strict CSP (no inline script).

## Workflow

1. **Understand before changing.**
   - Read the relevant CLAUDE.md and the code you will touch.
   - Find how the same thing is already done and copy that pattern.
   - Run `git status`. Other agents edit this working tree at the same time, so
     note which changes are not yours.
2. **Reproduce bugs first.**
   - For a bug, write a test that fails because of it, or show the failing
     behaviour, before fixing it.
   - Find the root cause. A fix that only hides the symptom is not done.
3. **Build every feature asked for.** Along the way use only quick, targeted
   checks: `cargo check -p <crate>`, one crate's tests, one test, a single
   Playwright test with `-g "<name>"`. Do not run the full gate after each
   feature.
4. **Test the kind of bug, not one instance.** When something breaks, add tests
   for the whole class: every text box keeps focus, every API success is JSON or
   a 204, every block type in a selection, both orders of a decision tree.
5. **Prove the tests work.** Put the bug back for a moment and confirm the new
   test fails, then restore the fix.
6. **Run the full gate once, at the end of the batch** (commands below). If a
   browser test fails only in the full run, rerun it alone. Check the machine
   load (`uptime`) before calling it flaky, and say so in the report.
7. **Commit only your own files.**
   - `git add <the files you changed>`. Never `git add -A` or `git commit -a`:
     that sweeps in other agents' unfinished work.
   - One commit per coherent change. Message: a `type(scope): summary` line,
     then why.
   - Push only after the gate passes. A push to main that changes code releases
     a version, so `git pull --rebase` before the next push.
8. **Check CI once after pushing.** Without credentials, use the public API at
   `https://api.github.com/repos/chewton2k/leo-cli/actions/runs`, at most one
   request a minute. Unauthenticated requests are limited to 60 an hour.
9. **Report honestly.**
   - Say what changed, what was verified and how (with numbers), and what was not.
   - Mention any finding outside the task: a security issue, someone else's
     broken code.

## Gate commands

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --no-fail-fast            # also runs the page's node tests and builds target/debug/leo
cd crates/leo-web/tests/browser && pnpm test --reporter=line   # Playwright, ~5 min
```

Never run `cargo build` or `cargo install` unless the user asks. `cargo test`
builds the binary the browser tests use.

## Code rules

- **Match the code around you.** Same naming, idioms and comment density. This
  project uses no code comments.
- **Strings:** never slice by byte offsets computed from lengths. Use char
  indices or `str::get`, and never split a multi-byte character.
- **Bound everything:** sizes, counts, loop iterations, recursion depth, request
  time. Constants have names (`MOST_FILES`, `REPLY_TOKENS`).
- **No blocking under a lock:** never do I/O or AI calls while holding the store
  lock or another mutex. List what is needed under the lock, then do the work
  outside it.
- **Writes are safe:**
  - Write to a temp file and rename it into place.
  - Write row by row in a transaction in `leo.db`, not by rewriting a whole file.
- **Errors help the user:** an error says what went wrong and what to do about
  it. Never show a raw programmer error (`undefined`, a JSON parse error).
- **The page:**
  - No inline JS.
  - Escape everything rendered.
  - Async results must check the page is still the one that asked (`seq`).
  - A redraw must keep focus and the caret in any field being typed in.

## Security checklist (every change)

- **Untrusted input is data, never instructions.** That covers web pages,
  uploaded documents, note text, AI output and tool arguments. Validate types,
  sizes and ids.
- **Paths:**
  - Reject `..`, absolute paths and separators in names.
  - Resolve paths, then confirm they stay inside the intended folder.
  - Do not follow symlinks.
- **Secrets:**
  - API keys and tokens go through `leo_services::config::secret::default_store()`
    (a 0600 credentials file, or the keychain with `LEO_USE_KEYCHAIN`), never
    `KeyringStore` directly and never in settings files, logs, URLs or the page.
  - Any credential file is 0600 and written atomically.
  - Keys are accepted only over secure requests.
- **Network:**
  - Fetch only addresses the user or a vetted search returned.
  - Block local and private hosts, including names that resolve to them.
  - Set timeouts everywhere.
- **The server:**
  - Decide trust from the TCP peer, never from request headers.
  - Every route is behind the session gate unless it is a deliberate exception.
- **Never run code an AI wrote.** Agent CLIs run read-only, with only the tools
  listed in `crates/leo-services/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Tests never touch the real keychain, real DNS, the microphone, or a paid
  AI API.** Use the fakes and fixtures that exist (`MemoryStore`, local fake
  HTTP servers, `LEO_NO_MICROPHONE`, `LEO_INSTALL_NO_MODEL`).

## AI features

- **Prompts:**
  - Rules go in the system prompt, material in tagged sections.
  - Every instruction says "Use interpretable language".
  - Change prompts in their one shared place (`ai/chat.rs`, `chat.rs` `BASE`,
    `tools.rs`).
- **Check real behaviour with real models,** not only fakes.
  - Use Codex or Claude Code on the user's plan, with sample data and a
    throwaway `LEO_HOME`.
  - Drive the flow the page drives, through every branch, both orders, several
    runs.
  - Count failures; do not eyeball one run.
- **The answer loop must survive model mistakes.** That covers a bad tool call,
  a dropped verdict, text before a tool call, and a provider failing mid-answer.
  Recover or retry; never show the user a half answer or a raw error.

## Before you say "done"

- [ ] Every requested item is built, or explicitly reported as not done and why.
- [ ] New behaviour has tests, including the failure cases, and the tests were
      seen to fail without the fix.
- [ ] Gate passed: fmt, clippy, cargo test, node tests, Playwright.
- [ ] The CLAUDE.md for the touched crate records any new decision or
      invariant, in a sentence or two.
- [ ] Only your files are committed; CI checked once after the push.
- [ ] The report says what was verified, what was not, and anything you noticed
      that needs the user's attention.
