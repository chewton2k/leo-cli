# leo

> Notes for programmers — fast, local, plain-text, AI-powered.

`leo` is a lightweight note manager that lives entirely in your terminal. No Electron app, no subscription. Just run `leo` and start typing. With built-in AI features, leo can record lectures, transcribe speech into structured notes, answer inline questions, and sync your notes to GitHub.

## Install and Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/you/leo
cd leo
cargo install --path .
```

### Setup

`leo` works with no API keys at all if you run models locally:

```sh
brew install ollama whisper-cpp
ollama pull qwen3:8b
```

Otherwise, store a key in your OS keychain — not a plaintext file:

```sh
leo model login openrouter   # free models via openrouter/free
leo model login groq         # free Whisper transcription
leo model list               # check what's configured
```

`leo model login` reads the key with echo disabled, so it never appears on
screen or in your shell history, and offers to import an existing `.env` value
if it finds one. `leo model list` reports only whether a key is stored, never the
key — and never reads it, since on macOS reading a keychain item can cost a
permission prompt.

Tune providers and fallback order in `leo config edit`. Providers are tried in
order and unavailable ones (no key, no binary, closed port) are skipped
silently, so listing more providers than you have installed is fine.

API keys are only required for AI features (`listen`, `ask`). All other commands work without them.

The older `leo env` command still works and writes a plaintext `.env`; env vars
take precedence over the keychain, which is useful in CI.


### Troubleshooting Installation
If this doesn't work, you can run a check for 
```sh
~/.cargo/bin/leo 
```

If that works you just need to add it to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc through: 
```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```



## Installation after modifications

```sh
# Reinstall after changes
cargo install --path . --force

# Uninstall (won't delete your notes)
cargo uninstall leo
```

### Optional dependencies

| Tool | Required for | Install |

| [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) | free local transcription | `brew install whisper-cpp` |

## Getting started

```sh
leo
```

That opens the full-screen interface: directories on the left, your notes in the
middle, the selected note on the right.

```
┌ dirs ────────┬ notes (3) ──────────────┬ Rust ownership ──────────┐
│ cs130/       │   1 Graph traversals    │ ## Ownership             │
│ cs162/       │   2 Rust ownership      │ - [ ] read the book      │
│              │   3 Midterm plan        │ - [x] write notes        │
└──────────────┴─────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
  :  command    ?  help    Ctrl-P  find    q  quit
 /cs130   Created a1b2c3d4
```

Move with `j`/`k`, switch panes with `h`/`l`, and press `?` for help at any
time. Anything that takes an argument goes on the `:` line, where Tab completes
note titles, directories, tags, and formats.

| Key | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| `j` / `k` | Move down / up |
| `g` / `G` | First / last |
| `h` / `l` | Switch pane |
| `Enter` | Open a directory, or focus the note body |
| `x` | Toggle the first open checkbox |
| `e` | Edit the note in `$EDITOR` |
| `D` | Delete the note, or the directory when the dirs pane has focus (asks first) |
| `:` | Command line |
| `/` | Search |
| `Tab` | Complete on the `:` line |
| `Ctrl-P` | Fuzzy find a note across all directories |
| `Ctrl-S` | Providers and settings |
| `Ctrl-D` / `Ctrl-U` | Scroll the preview |
| `Ctrl-R` | Reload from disk |
| `?` | Help |
| `q` | Quit |

Notes are numbered in the pane, so `:view 2`, `:edit 2`, and `:delete 2` all
refer to what you can see. Tab completion accepts a title and fills in the
number for you: type `:view owner` and press Tab.

Your first run creates one note called **leo manual** with the whole command
reference in it. It is an ordinary note, so you can search it, scroll it, and
delete it when you are done — it will not come back.

## Commands

### Notes

Type these on the `:` line, or use them as CLI subcommands.

| Command | What it does | Shortcut |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `new [title]` | Create a note (opens `$EDITOR`) | `n` |
| `list [#tag] [N]` | List notes, optionally filter by tag or limit count | `ls`, `l` |
| `view <note>` | View a note | `v` |
| `edit <note>` | Edit a note in `$EDITOR` | `e` |
| `delete <note>` | Delete a note | `rm`, `del`, `d` |
| `check <note> <N>` | Toggle checkbox N | `x` |
| `search <query>` | Search note titles | `find` |
| `search -f <query>` | Full-text search (titles + bodies) | |
| `tags` | Show all tags with counts | |

`<note>` can be a pane number (`view 1`), an ID prefix (`view 3f2a`), or a unique part of the title (`view ownership`).

### Directories

Organize notes into directories:

```
:mkdir cs130
:cd cs130          (or select it in the dirs pane and press Enter)
:new Lecture 1
:cd ..
:mv 1 cs130
```

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `mkdir <name>` | Create a directory |
| `cd <dir>` | Change directory (`..`, `/` supported) |
| `pwd` | Show current directory |
| `mv <note>... <dir>` | Move notes to a directory |
| `rmdir <name>` | Remove an empty directory |
| `rmdir -r <name>` | Remove a directory and everything in it (asks first) |

### Creating notes

`new` opens your `$EDITOR` with a frontmatter template:

```markdown
---
title: My Note
tags: rust, learning
---
Write your note here. Full markdown supported.

- [ ] Checkboxes work
- [ ] Like this
```

Save and quit to create the note. Empty body cancels.

### Checklists

Notes support markdown checkboxes and bullets:

```
:view 1
  [1] ☐ Write tests
  [2] ☑ Fix login bug
  • Remember to deploy

:check 1 1
  ☑ Write tests
```

## AI features

### Reminders

```
:remind me to buy groceries
:hey leo remind me to call mom
```

Reminders are stored as checkboxes in a `#reminder` note. Toggle with `check`.

### Listen (speech-to-notes)

Record audio and get AI-structured notes. Recording does not block the
interface — the preview pane fills in with notes as you talk:

```
:listen
┌ dirs ────────┬ notes (3) ──────────────┬ live notes (t for raw text) ─┐
│ cs130/       │   1 Graph traversals    │ - BFS explores a graph level │
│              │   2 Rust ownership      │   by level using a queue     │
│              │                         │ - DFS uses a stack instead   │
└──────────────┴─────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
 /   • Recording 01:23
```

Press `t` to switch between the condensed bullets and the raw transcript, and
`Enter` to stop. Stopping is not cancelling: the finished recording is
transcribed in one pass and saved as a note, so the result is the same quality
you would get without the live view.

```
:listen CS 101 Lecture       # custom title
:listen add 1                # append to an existing note
:listen --screen             # capture system audio instead of the microphone
```

Under the hood a background thread transcribes the last 15 seconds every 15
seconds and asks the chat model for a few bullets every minute, so the live view
costs a handful of small requests. Putting a local Ollama first in the chat chain
makes that part free.

**Requires:** SoX (`brew install sox`), plus at least one working provider in
each chain — either local (`ollama` + `whisper-cpp`) or a key for one cloud
provider (`leo model login openrouter`, `leo model login groq`).

### Inline AI prompts

Write `@leo` questions directly in a note and expand them with `ask`:

```markdown
## Rust ownership

@leo what is the difference between Box and Rc?
```

```
:ask 1
  Expanding 1 prompt...
  Updated "Rust ownership notes" 3f2a1b4c
```

The `@leo` line is replaced with the AI's answer inline. Works on the `:` line and as a CLI subcommand (`leo ask <id>`). Also triggers automatically when saving a note in `edit` if any `@leo` lines are present.

**Requires:** one working chat provider — a running `ollama`, or
`leo model login openrouter`.

### Export

```
:export 1 md
  Exported /Users/you/Desktop/My-Note.md
```

Formats: `txt`, `md`, `html`, `docx`, `pdf`, `rtf`, `odt` (last four need Pandoc).

### Providers and settings

Press `Ctrl-S` for the provider screen. It lists both chains — one for chat, one
for transcription — in the order they are tried, with each provider's model and
whether it has a key, and below them everything else that is configured:

```
┌ providers ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ chat chain                                                              │
│   1. ● ollama          qwen3:8b              no key needed              │
│   2. ○ openrouter      openrouter/free       no key — press l           │
│ transcribe chain                                                        │
│   1. ○ whisper_cpp     (default)             no key needed              │
│   2. ● groq            whisper-large-v3-turbo key stored                │
│ also configured                                                         │
│      gemini            gemini-2.5-flash      no key — press l           │
│      lmstudio          local-model           no key needed              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 l login · x remove key · t test · J/K reorder · a add · d drop · e edit file
```

A filled dot means leo would use that provider right now. A hollow one means it
is configured but not usable yet — a missing key, a binary that is not
installed, or a local server that is not running.

| Key | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| `j` / `k` | Move between providers |
| `l` | Store an API key (typing is hidden) |
| `x` | Remove a stored key |
| `t` | Send one small request to check it works |
| `J` / `K` | Change priority within a chain |
| `a` | Add the selected provider to its chain |
| `d` | Drop it from the chain (it stays configured) |
| `e` | Open `config.toml` in `$EDITOR` |

The same things work from a shell:

```sh
leo model list                 # both chains, models, and credential status
leo model test openrouter      # one minimal request to check it works
leo model login openrouter      # store a key in the OS keychain (echo disabled)
leo model logout openrouter    # remove it
leo config path                # where config.toml lives
leo config edit                # open it in $EDITOR
```

### Adding a provider

`config.toml` ships with 16 providers already defined — Ollama, OpenRouter, LM
Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM, Groq, Cerebras, Gemini, Mistral, OpenAI, DeepSeek,
Together, xAI, whisper.cpp, and two more for transcription. Only the free ones
are wired into a chain; the rest are one keypress away on the provider screen.

Adding your own is four lines of TOML and no code, as long as it speaks a
protocol leo already knows:

```toml
[providers.my-provider]
kind = "openai"                       # OpenAI-compatible chat completions
base_url = "https://api.example.com/v1"
model = "some-model-id"
key_env = "EXAMPLE_API_KEY"           # omit entirely for a local server
```

Then add its name to a chain:

```toml
[chat]
chain = ["ollama", "my-provider"]
```

The four protocols are `openai` (chat, and almost everything speaks it),
`whisper_cpp` (a local binary), `groq` (any OpenAI-compatible
`/audio/transcriptions` endpoint, including OpenAI's own), and `hf` (Hugging
Face inference).

Keys never go in this file — they live in your OS keychain, or in env vars,
which take precedence. All of them share one keychain item, so macOS asks for
permission at most once rather than once per provider. Reordering a chain or toggling a provider from the
provider screen rewrites only that one line, so your comments and formatting
survive.

### Serve

Access your notes from your phone or browser:

```sh
leo serve --port 3131
```

Opens a web UI with a QR code for easy phone access on your local network. This
one is CLI-only — it runs its own async server, so it is not a `:` line command.

Note that the server has no authentication: anyone who can reach that port on
your network can read and edit your notes. Run it on trusted networks only.

## Sync (GitHub backup)

Back up and sync your notes via git. Notes are stored as plain `.md` files, so your repo is readable on GitHub as-is.

```
:sync init               # initialize a git repo in your notes directory
:sync connect <url>      # connect to a GitHub remote
:sync push               # push notes to GitHub
:sync pull               # pull notes from GitHub (reloads store)
:sync status             # show git status
```

Or as CLI subcommands:

```sh
leo sync init
leo sync connect https://github.com/you/leo-notes.git
leo sync push
leo sync pull
leo sync status
```

Notes are auto-committed on every save when a sync repo is initialized — no manual commits needed.

## Scripting

All commands work as CLI subcommands for scripts and one-liners:

```sh
leo new "Quick thought" --body "Remember to refactor auth" --tags todo
leo new "Meeting notes"          # opens $EDITOR when --body is omitted
leo list --tag todo
leo search "refactor" --full-text
leo delete 3f2a --force
leo remind "buy coffee"
leo listen --title "Meeting notes"
leo export 3f2a md
leo ask 3f2a
```

## Data storage

Notes are stored as individual `.md` files with YAML frontmatter:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/leo/` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/leo/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\leo\` |

Each note is a file like `<uuid>.md`. Directory structure is mirrored on disk. Existing `notes.json` data is automatically migrated on first run.
